This script loads the California Housing dataset using scikit-learn and performs basic exploratory data analysis through summary statistics and visualizations. It generates a correlation heatmap to show the relationships between features and a histogram to visualize the distribution of median house values.

The goal of this script is to help users gain a quick understanding of the structure and trends within the housing dataset, which is commonly used for regression model training and evaluation.

This script uses the scikit-learn library (imported as sklearn), along with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. If you do not have these libraries installed, please ensure that you install them before running the code or it may not work.

The best way to install them is either using pip install or by using the python interpreter in the settings
